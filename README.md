# Treshold-Wizard
A simple OpenCV color thresholder that helps people identify necessary tresholds accross colorspaces. 
This interactive GUI lets people find the right tresholds for OpenCV applications. 
## Running
Make sure you have the OpenCV library installed on your machine. When you have the application running, experiment with the slider in the OpenCV window until you reach your desired color treshold. From there you can get your color treshold.
